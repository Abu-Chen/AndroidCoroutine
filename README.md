# AndroidCoroutine
There are four simple coroutine examples in this app.
1. Run asynchronous task.
2. Retry when result is fail. (The limit of run is 3 times.)
3. Retry when result is fail or timeout. (In this case, the task cost 4 seconds but timeout in 2 seconds, the limit of run is 3 times.)
4. Run 5 asynchronous tasks in the same time.
